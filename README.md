# نظام إدارة المكتبة (Arabic Library Management System)

Full-stack library management system with a fully Arabic, RTL user interface.

**Stack:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS → Node.js/Express → MySQL (XAMPP)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- XAMPP with MySQL running on port 3306 (default `root` user, no password)

## First-time setup

Already done for you in this environment, but for reference on a new machine:

```powershell
# 1. Start MySQL from the XAMPP control panel

# 2. Create the database schema
& "C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe" -u root --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -e "source backend\db\schema.sql"

# 3. Install dependencies
cd backend; npm install
cd ../frontend; npm install

# 4. Create the default admin account
cd ../backend; npm run seed
```

## Running the app

```powershell
# Terminal 1 - backend (http://localhost:5000)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - frontend (http://localhost:5173)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Cloud deployment (Hugging Face Spaces)

The repository includes a `Dockerfile` for deploying the frontend and API as one Docker Space.

1. Create a new Hugging Face Space and choose **Docker** as the SDK.
2. Upload or push this repository to the Space.
3. Create a managed MySQL database (for example, Aiven, Railway, or TiDB Cloud), then import `backend/db/schema.sql` into it.
4. Add these Space secrets/variables: `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `JWT_SECRET`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME`, and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
5. Set `NODE_ENV=production` and `FRONTEND_URL` to the public Space URL, then run the seed command once from a trusted environment with the same database variables: `npm run seed` from `backend`.

The Space listens on port `7860`. The frontend uses the same-origin `/api` path in production, so no frontend URL secret is needed. Database records are persistent in the managed MySQL service. PDF files currently use the container filesystem; use a persistent Space storage volume or move PDF storage to object storage before relying on cloud redeployments.

## Default admin login

The default admin username/password are set via `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `backend/.env` (see `backend/.env.example`), and are only used when running `npm run seed`. Set your own values there before seeding — do not use example defaults in production. Additional admin users can be created directly via the `users` table (passwords are stored with bcrypt hashing — never in plain text).

## Configuration

Backend settings live in `backend/.env` (copied from `.env.example`):

- `DB_*` — MySQL connection (defaults match a standard XAMPP install)
- `JWT_SECRET` — auto-generated random secret on first setup
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` — session length (default 8h)
- `MAX_PDF_SIZE_MB` — PDF upload size limit (default 50MB)
- `FRONTEND_URL` — allowed CORS origin
- `LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` / `LOGIN_LOCK_MINUTES` — account lockout after repeated failed logins (default 5 attempts / 15 min)
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` / `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES` — general API rate limit (default 300 req / 15 min per IP)
- `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` / `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES` — stricter limit on `/api/auth/login` (default 20 req / 15 min per IP)

Frontend settings live in `frontend/.env`:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` — backend API base URL (default `http://localhost:5000/api`)

## Security

This system was hardened against common threats while keeping it a **single-admin** system (no multi-role/RBAC — there is only one account tier, the admin login).

**Authentication & session**
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (never stored or logged in plain text).
- JWT secret and all credentials read from `.env` (never hardcoded); tokens expire after `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (default 8h).
- Account lockout: after `LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` failed logins, the account is locked for `LOGIN_LOCK_MINUTES` (HTTP 423), independent of IP rate limiting so an attacker can't bypass it by rotating IPs.
- Login/username errors are intentionally generic (no user enumeration).
- No refresh-token flow was added — deliberate trade-off for a single-admin internal tool; a shorter/longer `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` can be tuned instead.

**API hardening**
- `helmet` sets standard security headers on every response.
- `express-rate-limit`: a general limit on all `/api/*` routes plus a stricter one on `/api/auth/login`.
- All request bodies are validated with **Zod** (`backend/schemas/`) — invalid input is rejected with a 400 before touching the database.
- All SQL uses parameterized queries (`?` placeholders) or fixed, developer-controlled table names — no user input is ever concatenated into SQL.
- The global error handler never leaks internal error details to the client in production (`NODE_ENV=production`); full errors are still logged server-side for debugging.
- CORS is restricted to `FRONTEND_URL` with an explicit method/header allowlist.

**File uploads**
- Only PDF files are accepted, checked both by MIME type **and** by verifying the actual file signature (`%PDF-` magic bytes) after upload — a renamed non-PDF file is rejected and deleted.
- Stored filenames are always fully server-generated random names with a forced `.pdf` extension (the original filename/extension is never trusted), which also eliminates any path-traversal risk.
- Uploaded PDFs are never served from a public/static directory — only through authenticated view/download routes.
- A failed upload (invalid file, validation error) is fully rolled back: no orphan database rows or leftover files.

**Auditing**
- Every login, logout, and create/update/delete action (books, authors, publishers, arts, PDFs) is recorded in the `audit_logs` table (who, what, when, IP address).

**Frontend**
- No secrets of any kind live in frontend code (`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is just a URL).
- All routes except `/login` are wrapped in `ProtectedRoute` and redirect unauthenticated users automatically.
- A 401 from any API call clears the session and redirects to login.
- React escapes all rendered content by default and the codebase contains no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`/`eval`, so there is no XSS injection point for user-entered data (book titles, names, etc.).
- No sensitive data (tokens, passwords) is ever written to the browser console.
- **Known trade-off:** the JWT is kept in `localStorage` (not an httpOnly cookie) to keep the existing login flow simple; this is safe as long as the app has no XSS surface, which is verified above. Moving to httpOnly cookies would require CSRF protection and cross-origin cookie configuration — a larger change deliberately left out of this pass.

**Dependencies**
- `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities** in both `backend` and `frontend` (a moderate `qs`/Express advisory was fixed via a package `overrides` entry pinning `qs` to a patched version, without bumping Express's major version).

**Tests**

Backend tests run against a fully isolated database (`library_management_test`, auto-created/dropped by the test run — your real data is never touched):

```powershell
cd backend
npm test
```

Covers: login validation/lockout/success, protected-route rejection (missing/invalid token), input validation (empty/oversized/duplicate names), and PDF upload security (wrong MIME type, spoofed content, path-traversal filenames, randomized storage names).

## Notes

- Book IDs are never shown in the UI — books are referenced by title only.
- Book fields: title, authors (many-to-many), publisher, art/category, volume count (عدد المجلدات), shelf number (الرف رقم), and PDF files.
- Editing a book does **not** delete its existing PDF files automatically; PDFs are removed individually via their own delete button.
- All uploaded PDF files are validated by type and size on the backend, stored under randomized safe filenames, and served only to authenticated requests.
